 *     rising chord. The pitch shift is a delay line read at double speed with
 *     two crossfaded taps, and it sits inside the feedback so it builds up.
 *   - Bits and crush: only the tail goes through a bit quantiser and a
 *     sample-and-hold, so the dry stays clean and the room sounds like an old
 *     sampler.
 *   - Wobble: the comb lengths drift slowly and out of step, so a long tail
 *     never sits still, like tape.
 *
 * Freeze holds the tail forever and gate cuts it off.
