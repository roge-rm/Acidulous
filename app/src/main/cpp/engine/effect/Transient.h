/**
 * Transient shaper: `attack` brings the start of each hit up or down and
 * `sustain` the ring after it, whatever the level, so there's no threshold.
 *
 * Attack is a fast follower against a slow one: they part at an onset and
 * meet again once the hit settles. Sustain is a follower that holds against
 * one that lets go quickly, which part in the tail. `time` scales the
 * followers together.
 *
 * The extra is `split`: only what's above it is shaped (and listened to), so
 * a drum loop's hats and snare can snap while its kick stays as it was. At
 * the bottom of its range the whole sound is shaped.
 *
 * The second extra is the accent grid: with `grid` on, each hit is shaped by
 * where it lands in the bar. A row of steps (`a01`..`a16`, `length` of them,
 * each `rate` long, counted from the song's start and swung with the track)
 * says down, flat or up, and an up step gives the hit's attack `depth` dB
 * more, a down step that much less. The step is chosen at the hit's onset
 * and held for the whole hit. With grid off it plays exactly as without it.
