/**
 * De-esser: listens to a band around `freq` and turns it down when it goes
 * over `threshold`, by up to `range`. In `split` mode only that band is
 * turned down; `wide` turns the whole sound down instead, which is gentler
 * on a voice with a lot of air. `listen` plays the band it's listening to,
 * to find the frequency.
 *
 * The extra is `relative`: the band is measured against the whole sound
 * rather than against full scale, so the same setting catches an s on a
 * quiet line and a loud one. Its threshold is then how far under the rest
 * of the sound the band may come up to: an s is nearly all band, a vowel
 * has it 20 dB or more down.
