# The engine

Our own, from 2026-09-10; the vendored third-party subset that got the project
to M3 was removed in favour of this. Everything under `cpp/` is ours; the only
dependency is Oboe.

```
core/       the realtime plumbing, and nothing that reads a file:
            Constants · RtQueue (SPSC, wait-free) · Handover (Mount / Retire and the
            retire worker) · Params (ParamDef tables, 0..1 in, smoothed unit-range out) ·
            Messages (MidiMessage, ParamMessage) · Timebase · InputBus · Settings ·
            Frozen · Sample · SampleMap (zones + crossfades) · Take · Expression ·
            Utterance (Molt's analyser) · Capture
format/     reading and writing files, all ours except LAME:
            WavReader · WavWriter · AiffWriter · FlacWriter · Mp3Writer (LAME) ·
            Sf2Reader · AudioSink (the interface the four writers implement)
dsp/        Math · Osc (PolyBLEP saw/pulse) · Filter (TPT SVF) · MultiFilter (12 slopes +
            drive) · Envelope · Adsr (DADSR + repeat) · LfoGen · Lfo (note-value phase) ·
            Wavetable · Biquad · DelayLine · Delay · Reverb · Limiter · Click · Fft
machine/    Machine interface · MachineRegistry, then one directory each:
            reflux trinity ratio mosaic hexbeat forage genesis resonance cumulus
            pollen dice formulate manual filament brazen timber cipher molt nexus
effect/     Effect interface (onBlock for tempo, run() with bypass) · EffectRegistry ·
            Delay Reverb Eq Distortion Compressor Filter Bitcrusher Phaser Flanger
            Chorus Tremolo Width Shifter Harmonizer
modifier/    InputMod interface + MidiSink · InputModRegistry · Scales.h (33 scales,
            25 chords) · InputMods: Scale Chord Arp
rack/       Rack (clip player -> modifiers -> machine -> effects -> channel strip) ·
            MasterBus (sum, peak, sends, limiter) · Engine (the render loop)
../sequencer/  TickClock · Transport · Clip · ClipPlayer · Song · SceneScheduler ·
               Launcher · RecordQueue · ClockFollower · LinkFollower
../platform/   android/ (the JNI bridge) · drivers/ (the Oboe stream) · link/
../EngineHost  the only thing the app talks to
```

**Which way the arrows point.** `engine/` never includes anything from
`platform/` - that is what makes a headless host on another operating system a
matter of writing a new `platform/`, and it is checked by eye rather than by
the build, so keep it true. `engine/` and `sequencer/` do include each other:
`rack/Engine` owns the transport and the scheduler, so they are one layer in
two directories rather than two layers, and nothing has been gained by
pretending otherwise.


## Rules the audio thread lives by

- It never allocates, locks, logs, or blocks. Objects arrive through `Mount`
  records built elsewhere and leave through `Retire` records to a worker.
- One mount is applied per block, at the block boundary, after rendering.
- MIDI, parameters and recorded events each cross on their own `RtQueue`.
- A block is `kBlockFrames` (64) at `kSampleRate` (48 000); the Oboe driver
  adapts whatever burst the device wants to that with a carry buffer.
- Parameters are addressed by index into a unit's `ParamDef` table; names are
  resolved on the UI thread (`EngineHost::setParam`). Every parameter is
  smoothed per block.
