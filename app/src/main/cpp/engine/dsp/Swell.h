/**
 * Upward compression in up to three bands: everything above the floor is
 * pulled toward the ceiling, so quiet detail comes up and the loudest peaks
 * come down to meet it. At full amount and a slow release it acts like a
 * normaliser; at a fast release it follows the waveform and squashes a sound
 * into a wall.
 *
 * Shared by the Swell effect and Nexus's swell module, one sample at a time.
 *
 * The bands are split with gentle one-pole filters at 300 Hz and 5 kHz, and
 * each band is what's left after the one below is taken out, so with no gain
 * on them they add back to exactly the input: no phase shift, no dip at the
 * crossovers. `split` blends from one gain for the whole signal (0) to a gain
 * per band (1). A band's gain is kept within [kSpread] dB of the whole
 * signal's, so a band with almost nothing in it can't be pulled up on its own
 * and drag the tone around.
 *
 * The detector looks [kLook] samples ahead: the audio is delayed by that much
 * and the gain is set from the loudest sample in the window, so a peak is
 * caught before it arrives. That's the effect's whole latency.
