// Stereo convolution with a long impulse and no latency.
//
// The first 32 taps run directly. The rest are cut into partitions that grow
// eightfold (32, 256, 2048, 16384 samples), each size an overlap-save FFT
// convolution with a frequency-domain delay line. The 32-sample stage runs
// whole every 32 samples. A larger stage's work is due a whole partition
// after its input is complete, so it's spread in equal shares over that
// time, a share every 32 samples, which keeps the cost per block flat.
//
// Both channels go through one complex FFT (left in the real part, right in
// the imaginary). Everything happens on a fixed 32-sample grid counted from
// reset(), so the output doesn't depend on how the caller splits its blocks.
//
// Built (allocated, impulse transformed) off the audio thread. process() and
// reset() don't allocate.
