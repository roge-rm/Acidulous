/**
 * Draw: free reeds. Harmonicas, accordions, melodica, harmonium and the reeds
 * that sound through pipes (PLAN §4.26).
 *
 * Each note is a reed blown by the pressure across it (draw::FreeReed): the
 * breath or the bellows rise and fall, and the reed speaks, settles and
 * stops on its own. Velocity and pressure blow harder, which brightens the
 * sound as a real reed's does; the level follows the house law. Each reed is
 * tuned to sound its note (DrawTuning.h, as a maker files a reed).
 *
 * Harmonicas are holes instead (draw::HarpHole): two reeds in a channel and
 * the player's mouth behind them. Played like a player, a note goes where a
 * player would find it on a Richter harp in the harp's key, natural or bent,
 * and the pitch wheel bends it by moving the tongue (DrawHarp.h).
