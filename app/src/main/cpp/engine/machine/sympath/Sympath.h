/**
 * Sympath: plucked strings over a buzzing bridge, with strings ringing in
 * sympathy.
 *
 * Each note is a string (Filament's waveguide) lying over a wide, curved
 * bridge. Once it swings far enough towards the bridge it strikes it, harder
 * the further it swings, and every strike rings the bridge: a bright buzz on
 * every cycle, which keeps going as long as the string swings wide enough to
 * reach and fades as the note dies down.
 *
 * Under the played strings lie sympathetic strings, never touched, tuned to
 * the scale of the piece from its tonic: they pick up whatever's played that
 * lands on their notes and ring on after it. Drone strings struck with each
 * note, a tanpura that plucks its four strings by itself in time, slides from
 * note to note, and a finger pulling the string sideways to bend it up.
