/**
 * Fret: electric guitars and basses.
 *
 * Each note is a string (Filament's waveguide), plucked by a pick, a finger
 * or a slapping thumb at a point along it, and heard not as it sounds in the
 * air but as the pickups hear it: a magnet at a place under the string, which
 * hears some harmonics and is deaf to others, through the coil's own
 * resonance and the tone knob.
 *
 * On top of that a player's hands: a palm resting on the strings by the
 * bridge, a finger touching a node for a harmonic, slides from note to note,
 * the frets buzzing when a string is hit hard, and chords strummed across the
 * strings rather than struck at once. And an amp: clean, or driven, with a
 * speaker, and loud enough that what comes out of it shakes the strings back,
 * so a held note sustains or jumps up to a harmonic.
