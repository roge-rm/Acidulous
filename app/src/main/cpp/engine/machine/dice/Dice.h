// Dice, a loop slicer.
//
// A loop is sliced at its transients (using Pollen's detector) or on a grid,
// and each slice goes on a pad.
//
// Every trigger rolls against a few probabilities: swap the slice for
// another, reverse it, stutter it, drop it or jump it up an octave. So the
// loop reshuffles as it plays. Hold keeps the same rolls every pass, so a
// pattern you like can be recorded.
