// Cuts a recorded take into the parts Diction sings from.
//
// A take is one prompt sung on one note: a held vowel ("ee"), a diphthong
// ("eye", held on its first vowel and moving to the second at the end, as it's
// sung), or a consonant between two ahs ("ah-sah"). This finds where the
// singing is, the part of a vowel that holds steady, where a diphthong moves
// and where a consonant starts and ends, from the sound alone. A take it can't
// make sense of says why, so it can be sung again.
