/**
 * Chanter: drone instruments, bagpipes and the hurdy-gurdy.
 *
 * A bagpipe is a chanter (a conical pipe with a double reed, Timber's) and
 * two or three drones (narrow cylinders with single reeds), all blown from a
 * bag that keeps the pressure up between notes, so the drones go on while the
 * bag lasts. There are no rests on a chanter and no tonguing, so notes are
 * set apart by grace notes: a quick, high note before each one.
 *
 * A hurdy-gurdy is a rosined wheel bowing its strings for as long as it
 * turns: melody strings stopped by the keys, drone strings tuned to the key,
 * and the trompette, whose bridge (the dog) is loose, so it hops and buzzes
 * once the wheel turns fast enough. A player sets it buzzing in rhythm by
 * pushing the wheel on the beat.
