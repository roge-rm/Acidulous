// Brazen, a modelled brass instrument, one player or a section.
//
// A tube, a bell and a pair of lips, from tuba to trumpet. The lips are a
// valve whose opening depends on the pressure behind them and the pressure
// in the tube, which is why brass locks to its resonances and gets brighter
// as you blow harder.
//
// Each player in the section is a full instrument. The lock knob pulls their
// pitches toward the section's average: at 0 they're all slightly out, at 1
// they lock into one big horn.
