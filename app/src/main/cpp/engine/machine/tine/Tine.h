/**
 * Tine: struck and plucked tuned metal and wood.
 *
 * Each note is a handful of resonant modes, tuned to the ratios of the thing
 * struck: a wooden bar undercut so its overtones sit two octaves and a third
 * above the note, a metal bar left free, a tine clamped at one end, or the
 * hammered note of a pan, tuned to octave and twelfth. A mallet, a thumb or a
 * pin strikes it at a place along it, harder or softer, which decides how
 * much of each mode it gets.
 *
 * Around that the instrument: a tube under each bar that sings along with the
 * note, the turning discs in a vibraphone's tubes, a damper bar, the buzz of
 * a rattle on a thumb piano, the octave that grows out of a pan's note after
 * it's struck, rolls on held notes, and a bow drawn across a bar under
 * pressure.
 *
 * A note can melt into another model while it rings: each mode glides its
 * ratio (on a log scale, so the middle is out of tune with both), its ring
 * time and its share of a strike to its partner in the other model, paired
 * in order. A mode only one of them has fades out, or is fed from what the
 * note is ringing with until it sounds. `melt` is how long it takes, `heat`
 * how much velocity and pressure hurry it, and `return` has it go once or
 * back and forth.
