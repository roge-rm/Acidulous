// One string.
//
// A delay line one wavelength long with a filter in the loop, so the highs
// fade faster than the lows, like a real string. On top of that:
//
//   - Dispersion: real strings are stiff, so their partials run sharp. An
//     allpass chain in the loop does the same, like a piano.
//   - Tension: a string pulled hard is briefly sharp and settles as it
//     decays. The loop length follows the energy going round it.
//   - Damper: a second tap partway along is subtracted, like a finger on the
//     string. At a node it gives the harmonic instead of the note.
