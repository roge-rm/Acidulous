/**
 * Aviary: birdsong.
 *
 * A bird sings from its syrinx: two sound sources, one in each branch of the
 * airway, each a pair of folds that start to swing once the air pressure
 * passes a threshold and settle at a size set by how far past it the
 * pressure is. The two can sing at once, two pitches from one bird. Above
 * them a short trachea, the throat (a cavity the bird tunes to the note it's
 * singing) and the beak, opened wider for higher notes.
 *
 * A held note sets a bird singing a song pattern around that pitch, two
 * octaves up, in time with the tempo: a plain whistle, chirps sweeping down
 * or up, fast trills, a warbled song in phrases, a two-note call answered by
 * another bird, a dawn chorus of different birds mostly taking turns,
 * slow falling coos, or harsh caws in twos and threes.
