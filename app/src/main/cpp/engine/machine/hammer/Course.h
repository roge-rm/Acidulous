// The strings of one key: one, two or three, each a loop of velocity waves
// with the bridge at the join, tuned a hair apart and sharing the bridge.
//
// Each string's loop, from the bridge round to the bridge:
//   - the line, an integer number of samples;
//   - a first-order Thiran allpass for the fraction, which passes every
//     frequency whole (linear interpolation is a lowpass that changes with
//     the fraction, so treble notes would brighten and ring differently key
//     by key);
//   - a chain of first-order allpasses for the stiffness, its coefficient
//     solved offline so the first 30 partials land where the string's
//     inharmonicity puts them (Dispersion.h); or, for the long bass
//     strings, second-order sections designed at the note (see
//     designSections), which follow the stretch up to 5 kHz;
//   - a loss designed from three decay times, the fundamental's, the third
//     partial's and the seventh's, so the string rings for the time measured:
//     a pole and a zero close together, a shelf, since the loss rises above
//     the fundamental and then levels off, which a one-pole (rising for ever)
//     can't follow, and close together it barely moves the phase.
// No DC blocker in the loop: its phase lead near the note is a tenth of a
// radian, which flattens the low partials against the fundamental by a
// percent, and nothing tunes that out. The hammer pushes as much forward as
// back, so it puts no DC in, and what round-off leaves dies with the note.
// The loop is tuned from its own phase at the note, every filter counted
// (the Filament lesson): the line takes whatever is left of the period.
//
// The bridge takes a share of what the strings do together and none of what
// they do apart. Tuned a hair apart, together turns into apart and back: the
// prompt sound dies fast into the bridge, and what's left - the aftersound -
// rings on, beating. That's the piano's double decay, from its own physics.
// The board takes far more of the upper partials than of the fundamental
// (at middle C, -8 dB/s at the first, -39 at the seventh), so the share is
// b0 + b1 (1 - cos w): no phase, so it only takes, never detunes. The
// strings meet the bridge where they're read, where the next sample is
// already in the line, which is what lets the share look both ways.
//
// A string also moves across the board as well as into it. That motion is
// fed by the bridge, barely loses anything into it, and so rings on long after
// the motion the hammer gave has gone: the aftersound of a key with one
// string. It's one more lane, [polar], that the hammer doesn't strike.
//
// The hammer reads the strings' velocity where it strikes, from the two taps
// that are that point on the way out and on the way back, and pushes there.
