/**
 * Fathom: water and weather.
 *
 * Most of the sound of water is bubbles: a pocket of air caught under the
 * surface rings like a spring at a pitch set by its size (the smaller, the
 * higher), and rises in pitch as it nears the surface. A drip is a bubble and
 * the tap of the drop; rain is many drips, and the sound of what they land
 * on; a stream is a dense cloud of small bubbles and a few big ones; surf is
 * a wave's rush rising and falling. Wind is air rushing past things, in gusts,
 * and whistling where it's caught in a gap; fire is crackles, hiss and roar.
 *
 * A held note keeps the texture going, its pitch setting the size of the
 * bubbles or the note the wind whistles, its velocity how much.
